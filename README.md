Bamazon is a node command line app that allows the user to shop from a store front.  When the .js file is ran, the list of products appears in the terminal in a table format.  To achieve this the npm package cli-table was used.  Using the npm package inquirer, the user is prompted as to the item number they wish to purchase.  Following the selection of an item, they are then prompted to choose how many units of that product they wish to order.  When the user enters the unit amount, they are told their purchase has been confirmed and notifies them of their total.  If the unit number needed exceeds what supply the storefront has, then they are notified that their order cannot be completed and if they wish to continue shopping.  With an executed order, the user is asked as well if they would like to continue shopping.  If yes, the product screen reappears and if not, the application closes.
